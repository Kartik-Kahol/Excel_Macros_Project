# Excel_Project

**Cleaning Operation**

1) Excel Macros was used for this operation
2) Objective was to copy data from raw file to main file. Before doing that we also need to clean the raw file first. Both these file were kept in a share drive location . 
3) First_File.xlsx is the main file where we need to copy new data and Second_File.xlsx is raw sheet which needs to be cleaned.
4) I used VBA code to open 2 files from sharepoint location
